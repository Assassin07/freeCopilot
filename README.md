# freeCopilot

**English** | [中文](./README.zh_CN.md)

## Background, github Copilot has started charging, but is still free for popular open source projects and student users.

For github to use our code for training, but charging us, the price is too high, if you convert more than 60 yuan in name and currency for a month, it is still a little tight for our friends who have just graduated. But as soon as I got out of my identity and wanted to save use, I thought of this project.

## Participation Form Assumptions

You can mention pr, add your own github, and then you can voluntarily add your own blog or your own official website address. If it becomes popular in the future, you can also promote it to yourself~

## Everyone have other ideas, you can also pr mention it~
